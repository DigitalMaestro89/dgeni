## Dgeni Logo

![](dgeni-logo-600x400.png)


### Fonts

The fonts used in the logo are:

* Main "dgeni" text : **[American Typewriter](http://www.ufonts.com/fonts/american-typewriter.html)**.
The idea of dgeni generating documentation and traditionally computer text being written in a "typewriter"
fixed width font was inspiration for this.
* Tag line "the versatile documentation generator" : **[Verdana](http://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/verdana)**.
This clean and easily readable font that complemented and didn't compete with the main font was the
driver here.

### Image

The image in the logo is of a small british bird called a [Wren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren)
Etymologically, the name can be considered to indicate that this is the "king of the birds"!

Charles Dickens created a character called Jenny Wren, who brightens the pages of
["Our Mutual Friend"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Mutual_Friend). Jenny Wren is a young diabled woman who
makes dolls' dresses.

Paul McCartney even made a song about it/her: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Wren and

The similarity of the sound of **Jenny** to **dgeni** was the inspiration here. Hopefully it may help
people remember how **dgeni** is pronounced.
